## What is the Fuel Developer Champions Program?

The Fuel Developer Champions Program is designed to recognize and reward the most active and engaged developers in the Fuel community. The program is open to all developers who are interested in building on Fuel. The program is designed to empower Fuel developers, help unlock your potential, and provide more opportunities to level up your skills and participate closely in the future development of Fuel.

To become a part of the program you need to have some experience with Fuel and the Fuel tech stack. The program provides:

* Opportunities to build your skills and showcase your work
* Tools to support you in your professional development and career growth
* Avenues to lift up your own developer presence in the Fuel community and help others at the same time.
* Exclusive merch based on level and contributions
* Chances to join Champions only events and meetups both online and in person

Champions are auto-renewed every year once they have been accepted into the program, pending being active in the program. An inactive Champion over the course of a calendar year will risk being removed from the program. Once accepted, we encourage you to participate in initiatives and discussions and take full advantage of what the program has to offer!

### Champion Levels

The Fuel Developer Champions Program has 4 levels:

* **Pioneers**: Pioneers are the first step in the program for those web3 developers who have only recently started building on Fuel. Pioneers have a good background in blockchain development already and are now ramping up on Fuel. All Champions start at either the Pioneer level or, if they have more experience on Fuel, at the Explorer level.
* **Explorers**: Those developers who have already begun building on Fuel and contributing to the Fuel ecosystem are Explorers. This may be the first step into the champions program for new participants or the first level up for those who joined as Pioneers. 
* **Navigators**: Navigators are experienced Fuel developers. They may have started building their first robust dApp on Fuel, worked on an issue in one of the Fuel open source repos, or contributed in a meaningful way to the Fuel documentation. Developers at this level are actively engaging with the broader blockchain community and acting as an ambassador for Fuel. They mentor new developers to the ecosystem and are invested in seeing Fuel continue to develop and grow.
* **Legends**: The pinnacle of the champions are the Legends. These are the developers in Ful who have contributed extensively to the project through building successful projects, working on core repositories of Fuel, mentoring and onboarding newer devs to Fuel, and offering guidance that helps shape the future direction of the project. They possess deep expertise and have a strong visionary approach that makes them pivotal to the next steps of the network. A developer can only become a Legend through a nomination by the community for their outstanding contributions to the Fuel ecosystem.
